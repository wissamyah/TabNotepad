        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>At TabNotepad, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and protection of your data when you use our browser extension.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>TabNotepad is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All information is stored locally on your device and is used solely for the functionality of the extension.</p>

        <h2>Permissions and Their Usage</h2>
        <p>TabNotepad requires certain permissions to function effectively. Here's a breakdown of the permissions we use and why:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>tabs:</strong> This permission allows TabNotepad to access and manage your browser tabs. It's used to display your open tabs in the extension popup and enable quick switching between tabs.</li>
            <li><strong>storage:</strong> This permission is used to store your notes and extension settings locally on your device. It ensures that your data persists between browser sessions and is never sent to external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> This permission gives TabNotepad access to the currently active tab. It's used to associate notes with specific tabs and to provide context-aware functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These permissions are essential for the core functionality of TabNotepad and are used solely for the purposes described above.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data, including your notes and extension settings, is stored locally on your device using the browser's built-in storage mechanisms. This data is subject to your browser's security measures and is not accessible to other extensions or websites.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>TabNotepad does not integrate with or use any third-party services that would have access to your data.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information. You can view, edit, or delete your data at any time through the extension interface or by managing your browser's local storage.</p>
